  https://calendly.com/michellbrito
  
  On the Calendly page, be sure you have the correct time zone selected in the section labeled "Times are in"
  
  If our availability doesnâ€™t sync, let me know and I'll see if we can figure something out.
  
  
  Maximum tutorial sessions per week - our week is Monday - Sunday.
  Part-time (6 month boot camp) students are entitled to 1 session per week.
  Full-time (3 month boot camp) students are entitled to 2 sessions per week. 
  
  If you have any questions or none of the times available work for you please let me know and I would be happy to help.
  
  If you would like to schedule regular, recurring sessions at the same day/time each week, just let me know by REPLY ALL and we can work it out.  This is particularly useful if you have a strict schedule so you won't have to compete for time on my calendar.
  
  CC Central Support on all email by always using REPLY ALL.
  
  Sincerely,
  Michell Brito`;
